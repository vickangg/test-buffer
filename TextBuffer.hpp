  // INVARIANT (cursor iterator):
  //   `cursor` points at an actual character in the list, or is
  //   at the past-the-end position (i.e. an end() iterator).

  // INVARIANT (row/column):
  //   `row` and `column` are the row and column numbers of the
  //   character the cursor is pointing at, determined by the
  //   placement of '\n' newline characters in the buffer.
  //   row is 1-indexed, whereas column is 0-indexed.

  // INVARIANT: (index)
  //   `index` is the 0-based index of the character the cursor is
  //   pointing at, or equal to the total number of characters in the
  //   list if the cursor is at the past-the-end position.
  //   0 <= index <= data.size()

  // The above invariants are established by the constructor and are
  // assumed to hold at the start of any member function call (i.e.
  // they are implicit conditions in the REQUIRES clause). Each function
  // must maintain these invariants (if they are temporarily broken, the
  // function must restore them before it returns).
